1) Kotlin runs on the JVM. It is a JVM language. Just like any normal java file class it get compile into class byte
   code after that Kotlin runtime Jar get add in it and generate the output.

2) val cannot be reassigned and var is re-assignable. val work as a constant.

3) Type inference : is when you create a variable without mentioning the data type
   e.g val msg = "vishal"
   ctrl+shift+p   : to view the data type

   to provide the data type while creation : val score: Int = 12

4) Ranges in kotlin: 1..4 --> 1 to 5 including 5
   until keyword :  1 until 5 : excluding upper bound

5) When is Switch case in java
        in the case of when you can also pass the logic
